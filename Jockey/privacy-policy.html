                <p>
                    This document details the policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information collected for the purposes of providing and improving the application. Your information is not shared with anyone except as described in this document.

                <h1>Information Collected</h1>
                <p>
                    Jockey collects anonymized data when the app is in use. This data consists of crash reports, general analytics (for example, when the app is in use), and analytics for specific events (for example, when starting playback for a new track list). Each of these events may collect additional information about the device including, but not limited to, device manufacturer, device model number, Android version, and app version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using Jockey, you agree to provide these analytics. Users may optionally opt-out of analytics for specific events when the app is started for the first time, or at any time from the settings page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data collected is used to inform development decisions based on feature usage and device demographics. This information does not personally identify users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All information described in this section is collected through Crashlytics, and is subject to the terms specified in <a href="https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf">their privacy policy</a>.

                <h1>Changes to this Policy</h1>
                <p>
                    This policy may be updated from time-to-time. You will be notified through the app when this happens. By continuing to use Jockey, you agree to the updated terms described in this document as it is revised.
