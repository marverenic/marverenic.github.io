                    This document details the policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information collected for the purposes of providing and improving the application. Your information is not shared with anyone except as described in this document. By using Jockey, you agree to the terms established in this document.

                <h1 id="information-collected">Information Collected</h1>
                <p>
                    Jockey collects anonymized data when the app is in use. The data collected varies by app version.
                </p>
                <h2 id="version-3.0">Jockey 3.0 and Later</h2>
                <i>
                    This section applies to version 3.0 RC 2 and higher (including stable version 3.0 and up). For older beta versions, see <a href="#version-2.2">Jockey 2.2 and Earlier</a>.
                </i>
                <p>
                    Jockey collects data when it is running related to application stability. Specifically, crashes and internal errors that occur while Jockey is running are reported to Bugsnag. These bug reports may also contain data including, but not limited to, device model and manufacturer, operating system version, memory and storage conditions, and application logs that may include information about how the app is being used. All data collected is subject to the <a href="https://docs.bugsnag.com/legal/privacy-policy/">Bugsnag privacy policy</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On version 3.0 and higher, Jockey does not collect specific statistics while it is in use. In previous versions of Jockey, such data collection was enabled and users could opt-out. The option to enable or disable statistic collection has been removed, and all installations of Jockey 3.0 or higher will no longer collect or send this data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Changes that affect Jockey 3.0 do not affect any data that has previously been collected or will be collected by earlier versions of the app.
                </p>
                <h2 id="version-2.2">Jockey 2.2 and Earlier</h2>
                <p>
                    Jockey collects data including crash reports, general analytics (for example, when the app is in use), and analytics for specific events (for example, when starting playback for a new track list). Each of these events may collect additional information about the device including, but not limited to, device manufacturer, device model number, Android version, and app version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using Jockey, you agree to provide these analytics. You may optionally opt-out of analytics for specific events when the app is started for the first time, or at any time from the settings page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data collected is used to inform development decisions based on feature usage and device demographics. This information does not personally identify users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All information described in this section is collected through Crashlytics, and is subject to the terms specified in <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">the Firebase privacy policy</a>.
                </p>

                <h1 id="updates">Changes to this Policy</h1>
                <p>
                    This policy may be updated from time-to-time. You will be notified through the app when this happens. By continuing to use Jockey, you agree to the updated terms described in this document as it is revised.
